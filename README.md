⛔ Initial contract creation had an error due to: MetaMask Tx Signature: User denied transaction signature.

✅ Resubmitted, mined, and verified successfully

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Remix IDE

MetaMask wallet with sufficient testnet/mainnet funds

Solidity 0.8.x or compatible

Deployment Steps
Open Remix and load the XYZ contract.

Compile the contract using the "Solidity Compiler" tab.

In the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab:

Connect your wallet (MetaMask).

Select the appropriate environment/network.

Set the gas limit as suggested by Remix.

Click "Deploy."

If you encounter an error such as User denied transaction signature, ensure to approve the transaction in MetaMask.

If you suspect a gas issue, gently increase the gas limit and retry.

On successful mining, note the contract address and transaction hash.

Verification
The contract was verified via Sourcify.

For re-verification or to verify on other block explorers, submit your contract's Solidity source code and metadata.

Troubleshooting
User denied transaction signature:
Approve the signature request in MetaMask.

Not enough gas:
Increase the gas limit slightly; avoid excessive increases.

Verification failed:
Double-check the compiler version and optimization settings.
